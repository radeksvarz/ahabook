Put all static files / folders here.

At least:

 - favicon.ico
 - robots.txt

To avoid 404 errors in logs.

The files will run with runserver, and when you push to Openshift, collectstatic will copy all necessary static files to wsgi/static.

DO NOT PUT STATIC FILES IN wsgi/static, that isn't the right way to do it.
